>This project builds on the original OGX360 by Ryzee119: https://github.com/Ryzee119/ogx360/
>
>The information provided in this repo is for informational purposes only.
>
>The ATMEGA32U4 chips will need to be programmed with the arduino bootloader before they are put on the PCB. One option may be to remove the chips
>from an arduino and transplant them.
>
>Please respect the license files found within this project. What we do, and the joy we gain from that would not be possible without those who shared the
>information with us to start with. Please respect and honor that by doing the same with any works derived from this or other projects linked to in this repo.

>Also my spelling sucks, so I apologize for any type-ohs that exist.
