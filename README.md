As mentioned in the quote, this is a derivative of the work of Ryzee119.  It allows more modern (both wireless and wired) controllers to be used with the original xbox.  This derivative is an internal mod that is plug and play.  It allows for 4 controllers to be used at the same time.  While the mod is active (external switch to activate/deactivate mod), the front ports on the xbox are inactive.  When the switch is turned off, the mod is inactive and the front ports are active.  For a list of compatible controllers, please see Ryzee119's github linked above.  I did not create this project.  I only recreated it on my own and updating documentation as I believe it to be.  I provide no warranties of my work (I could be wrong) and take no responsibility for anything you may do with this information.  As quoted above, this is for informational purposes only.  With the information I posted here... I have created fully working boards.
