Some parts are "obsolete" in Digikey, but You can find them elsewhere.
I recommend you order extra connectors as it's easy to mess them up!
I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend you order lots of extra Crimp pins (both for money per crimp, and some WILL mess up)

Things not in the BOM you will need:
- 28 awg wire (recommend silicon)
- 30 awg wire (again silicon)
- Pin headers (1x3 and 2x4s)
